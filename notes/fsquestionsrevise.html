<p style="text-align: left;">The <mark>amount of marks</mark> a question gives provides a <strong>good indicator of how much should be written:</strong>

Question A is generally <em>1 or 2 marks</em>, so use 1 or 2 sentences:
Briefly explain what you understand by the term ‘plot’. <strong>[2]</strong>
The plot is a series of events that tell a story and/or emphasize narrative. The three-act structure is an example of a structure that can be utilized for a plot.

In questions such as C or D there are often <mark class="blue">bullet points that say “In your answer; you may consider:” This “may” means must.</mark> You should follow these bullet points and <strong>base how you structure your answer from them.</strong>

Sometimes questions may contain technical terms you can use in your answer, <strong>often within parentheses.</strong>

“Briefly describe the mood or look of this location or setting.” – <mark>Mood refers to genre conventions and aesthetics within the general tone of the film:</mark>
– <strong>Horror</strong> <em>(dark, forbidding, threatening, dangerous)</em>
– <strong>Sci-fi</strong> <em>(alien, unsettling, dangerous, mysterious)</em>

<strong>DO NOT</strong> write about the moods/emotions of the <em>character</em>, the question is <mark class="blue">not about this.</mark>

“Briefly explore how the mood or look of the film makes you feel.” – How you feel refers to how the <strong>audience feels</strong> based on the content of the film, <em>NOT your own personal anecdote.</em>

“Distinct look or style” – You can mention genre conventions or context such as if the Director had mentioned they had taken inspiration from other films to make a similar look or style. <mark>This is also useful when the question states you may consider “the filmmakers’ intentions and influences.”</mark>

When answering a fifteen mark question you should write AO1 & AO2 within your writing structure, do this through showing “excellent” film knowledge and “excellent” analysis. <mark class="blue">AO1 is out of 5, AO2 is out of 10.</mark>

OVERALL, it’s <strong>VERY</strong> important to read the whole question.
