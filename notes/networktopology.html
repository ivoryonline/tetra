<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">what is network topology anyways?</strong>
<strong>Network topology</strong> is just a word to describe the general structure of a network: how it's laid out and how <mark><em>nodes</em></mark> connect. (Node is a word that describes anything connected to a network, such as computers, printers, or reciprocators of the network.)
When considering a network topology, some of the factors to take into account are: <mark class="blue">cost, transfer speed, & scalability.</mark>

There are <strong>four</strong> main types in OCR Computer Science:
— Star networks
— Mesh networks
— Bus networks
— Ring networks

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Star Networks</strong>
Star networks are a type of network topology that involves a central switch; all nodes connect to this main central switch.

<img src="../assets/images/notes/star.jpg">

Advantages of a star network:
— If one node loses communication to the central switch, <mark>the rest of the network is unaffected.</mark>
— Data transfer is <strong>fast</strong> as each wire is connected to the hub and not shared with <em>other computers</em>

Disadvantages of a star network:
— Additional setup is required for this network topology as a <mark class="blue">central switch and network cables are required.</mark>
— The network can <strong>not</strong> be wireless.
— The network is centralised to the central switch; so if the central switch goes down, <em>so does the rest of the network.</em>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Mesh Networks</strong>
Mesh networks have nodes that are <mark>connected to each other instead of being connected to a central node</mark> such as a <em>central switch.</em>
There are <strong>two</strong> main types of Mesh networks in OCR GCSE: <mark class="blue">Partially connected & Fully connected mesh networks.</mark>
Each node is <mark>capable of sending and receiving</mark> data from <em>other nodes.</em>

<img src="../assets/images/notes/meshfull.png"><img src="../assets/images/notes/meshpartial.jpg">

Advantages of a <em>full</em> mesh network:
— No <mark class="blue">single point of failure</mark>
— The fastest path of connection is found and used
— No node is isolated
— Data is likely to transfer properly because <strong>multiple nodes</strong> can provide the <em>same connection</em>

Disadvantages of a <em>full</em> mesh network:
— If one node is down it can affect the speed of others
— If wired it is often more <strong>expensive to setup than alternatives</strong>
— Network maintanence and administration is <mark>often more difficult than alternatives;</mark> a larger amount is also needed

Advantages of a <em>partially connected</em> mesh network:
— No single point of failure
— Network administration and maintanence is <strong>less needed than in a fully connected mesh network</strong>
— No node is isolated
— Data is <em>likely</em> to transfer properly because <mark class="blue">multiple nodes can provide the same connection</mark>

Disadvantages of a <em>partially connected</em> mesh network:
— If one node <strong>goes down</strong> it can affect the speed of others
— Not all nodes are connected to each other so data <em>may not transfer</em> at rates as <em>fast</em> as a <strong>partially connected</strong> mesh network

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Bus Networks</strong>
Bus networks are a network topology that involves having <strong>several nodes connect using one main cable.</strong>
All nodes are attatched to this cable and <em>use it to send/recieve data.</em>

<img src="../assets/images/notes/bus.jpg">

Advantages of a bus network:
— Very easy to setup because it only uses <strong>one</strong> cable
— <em>Low cost</em> to build in small networks
— The simple layout is <strong>easy to understand</strong>

Disadvantages of a bus network:
— Centralised to the main cable, <mark>if the main cable breaks then the whole network stops working</mark>
— The more nodes there are connected, <strong>the more collisions</strong> the network has <em>(this slows the network down)</em>
— <em>Quickly</em> becomes slow and unreliable for large networks

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Ring Networks</strong>
Ring networks are a <mark class="blue">network topology that involves all devices being connected in series<em></mark> (this is usually represented as a circle.)</em>
The data passes from <strong>once device to another</strong> until it eventually reaches the <em>computer it was intended for.</em>
They are <strong>often</strong> used in smaller networks that are <mark>unlikely to be scaled upwards.</mark>

<img src="../assets/images/notes/ring.jpg">

Advantages of a ring network:
— <strong>Zero data collision</strong> due to the cyclical structure
— Simple to setup since the <mark class="blue">arrangement is very straightforward</mark>

Disadvantages of a ring network:
— Has to go through <em>every node</em> which is much slower than <strong>other network topologies</strong>
— Very hard to troubleshoot, maintain, and administrate
— The network <em>must</em> be closed to add more devices
