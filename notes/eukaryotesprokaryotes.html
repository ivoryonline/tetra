<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">what the fuck is a eukaryote???</strong>
Plants & animal cells are <em>both</em> <b><mark>eukaryotic cells.</mark></b> So what the fuck is a <strong>eukaryote?</strong>

Cells have many "cellular components" such as the cell membrane, <mark class="blue">DNA,</mark> ribosomes, and cytoplasm. These are the <mark>base requirements for an organelle to be considered a cell.</mark> Cells may have other varying aspects though; such as <strong>whether or not they contain a nucleus.</strong>

This is particularly important as it's one of the <strong>defining features</strong> of eukaryotic cells: their DNA is <mark class="blue">enclosed within a nucleus.</mark> Eukaryotic cells also vary in size that's <em>usually</em> between <span class="monospace">10µm</span> and <span class="monospace">100µm</span>

<strong>Animal & Plant Cells</strong> are examples of <mark>eukaryotic cells.</mark> Some more examples are:
— Sperm cells
— Muscle cells
— Nerve cells
<em>(notice how all these cells have <strong>nuclei</strong>)</em>


<strong style="text-decoration: underline;">what the fuck is a prokaryote???</strong>
Essentially; <em>just flip it around.</em> Prokaryotic cells <strong>don't</strong> have their <mark class="blue">DNA enclosed within a nucleus</mark> — if you ever see a cell with a loop of DNA floating around & the cell-membrane surrounded by a <strong>cell wall</strong> <em>(yea the cell wall thing is new)</em>, then you're looking at a <mark>prokaryotic cell!</mark>
The DNA doesn't <em>really</em> have to be present though, it can always just have a lack of a nucleus and a cell wall.

The <mark class="blue">size of prokaryote's are much much smaller in comparison to eukaryotic cells:</mark> typically measuring ~ <span class="monospace">1µm</span> in size.
