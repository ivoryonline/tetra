<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">what happened in <em>christmas carol?</em></strong>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Stave 1</strong>
The story starts with telling us <mark>Jacob Marley had died many years ago.</mark>
Scrooge is shown to be a person <strong>everyone is scared of,</strong>
One snowy christmas eve in London a greedy and grouchy old man named "Ebeneezer Scrooge", is inside of his cold accounting house.
While he works he keeps a close eye on his clerk <strong>Bob Cratchit</strong> who shivers next to a pitifully small fire
Bob Cratchit is exited in hopes he will soon be let off work to <mark class="blue">celebrate Christmas!</mark> Scrooge agrees under the circumstance he comes even earlier to work the next day <em>(emphasizing how Scrooge priorites work over everything)</em>
Whilst this is happening; <strong>Scrooge's nephew comes by</strong> to wish his uncle a merry Christmas and invite him to <mark>Christmas dinner the next day.</mark>
Scrooge rejects the offer, saying <strong>"bah", "humbug!"</strong>, stating how he <em>hates</em> christmas.
Scrooge is then reveleaed as a <strong>miser</strong> when two charity workers approach scrooge and request a donation for charity. Scrooge says: <mark class="blue">“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”</mark>
Once Bob Cratchet is allowed to go home, Scrooge heads to his apartment where on his door-knocker he has a vision of his former business partner Jacob Marley who had died many years ago.  Scrooge feels convinced it is just a bit of food poisoning; though still shaken.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Stave 2</strong>
Ghost of christmas past is met. We get shown Scrooge's past where he was a lonely school boy with no friends and liked to read. <strong>Scrooge sympathises for himself and also for the young caroler that came to his door earlier.</strong> There is a difference here from when he's an adult as he chooses to be <em>"as solitary as an oyster"</em> when he is an adult, but rather lonely without choice when he was a child.
We then meet little fan who collects him from school, she's very happy and very close to Scrooge, however <em>she is dead in present time.</em>
We then also meet Fezziwig; <mark>he represents generosity and joy, he's wealthy like Scrooge yet very giving, in return he's very well respected.</mark> Scrooge sees this and reflects on himself, seeing how <strong>it's possible to be wealthy yet also generous and respected.</strong>
We then see Belle, who is Scrooge's fiance; she broke up with Scrooge because she felt Scrooge was <strong>prioritising money over herself and their life together.</strong>
Scrooge and us learn that Belle has a new family and children — <mark class="blue">though Scrooge is sad to see how Belle talks negatively of him.</mark>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Stave 3</strong>
We meet the Ghost of Christmas Present. This ghost is a very jolly and happy-looking ghost who has an appearance similar to that of Santa Clause.
The ghost takes Scrooge to the Cratchit's family where they are <strong>celebrating christmas;</strong> Scrooge is being talked about, Mrs Cratchit dislikes him though <mark>Bob Cratchit tries to give some defense.</mark> We also meet Tiny Tim who is a child of the Cratchit's and crippled. <strong>Scrooge shows an attatchment to Tiny Tim;</strong> he asks the ghost what will happen to Tiny Tim and the ghost <em>insinuates Tiny Tim will die.</em>
We also see Fred's Christmas, where Fred's family mocks Scrooge in a game, though <strong>Fred always wants to reach out to Scrooge and offer him a Christmas with them every year.</strong>
Then there is the reveal of two children underneath the robe of the Ghost of Christmas Present, <mark class="blue">one represents ignorance and one represents want. They are ill and crippled, the ghost says the children are a result of selfishness in society.</mark>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Stave 4</strong>
Now we meet the <em>ghost of Christmas Future.</em> This ghost has an appearance similar to that of <strong>the grim reaper.</strong>
We first see the wealthy part of London where his friends are talking about the death of someone; <mark>they don't see to care much though.</mark>
We then see the poor part of London where Mrs Dilber is selling <strong>Scrooge's belongings in a pawn shop.</strong>
Next we see Caroloine who owes Scrooge money, though says <mark class="blue">she is glad he has died as she may not have to repay the money now.</mark>
After all this, we are shown Tiny Tim is dead, <em>this upsets Scrooge greatly.</em>
Scrooge wonders who this man everyone seems to dislike and not care about is, <strong>he asks to see the name and sees his gravestone;</strong> realising they were talkin about <em>him.</em>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Stave 5</strong>
Scrooge wakes up after begging for another chance to the Ghost of Christmas Future. He <strong>promises to himself he will change</strong> and then gives money to charity. <mark>He also buys a turkey for the Cratchits,</mark> he spends the day with Fred and gives Bob Cratchit a raise <strong>the next day.</strong>
