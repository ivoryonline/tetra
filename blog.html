Welcome to the first post ever; I usually intend to yap for very very long amounts of time, though im not doing that for now as it's very late and I just used all my energy on creating this site :bwaah:
Do expect, *in future* very long yap sessions of me rambling on about random information that's on my mind, there **will** be times of *venting* :bwaah: and times of *going into a very long and unnecessary rant about my desire to be more feminine or expunge dysphoria from my life* — though for now all you're getting is a brief introduction into this website!!!! >:3
I have more projects planned (as always, *blame adhd*) — you can also expect to hear more about my life and day-to-day occurances as well as anything substantial that introduces itself into my day-to-day existence.
I'm dumb, young, and still learning, so think of this place as more of an outlet into a young and confused mind rather than of any notable information; however, if you're interested in who I am, how I am, or trying to understand what I.... *was*? *(if I'm dead)* — then you've come to the right place!

I plan to do a bunch of random images of GMod in each entry but I don't really know how consistent I'll be with that, so for now you can just have these:

I love CRT monitors by the way :-3

I don't have too much to scribble on about; though I do have another image!! woa !!

This is my desktop as of now, I do have two monitors; but I thought a one-monitor-screenshot would look ***cooler***

I'm going to maybe add comments and highlights of all styles soon, so you can expect updates and changes. Beyond that, I'm basically done for now; sorry for such a short entry. Oo and also, it's Christmas day very very soon, so that's always nice :3
*(Also want to add music attatchments to entries I really like doing that)*

Anyways~ that's all for now! GOODNIGHT!! if you actually read this, maybe let me know ^^, I'm sure you can provide insights on improvements or perspective :£
Seeya on teh flipside :z
