<p style="text-align: left;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Why'd I make this site?</strong>
<mark>I realised how much I was relying on AI (a lot)</mark>; and more <strong>importantly</strong>, — how much less competent it had made me.
So I decided to create <em>this site</em> — Tetra!, which uses <mark class="blue">ZERO Artifical Intelligence in it's design & creation.</mark>
The general purpose of this site is just to accommodate any content I want to publicise onto a website, whilst having my own place that I can <em>kinda</em> call my digital home!

<strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Why'd you name it Tetra?</strong>
It's just the first word that I thought of when I needed a name for this site; went with it and also searched up what Tetra meant, found a <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetra" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> — decided they were pretty cool and went with a Pristella maxillaris (a type of Tetra) as the favicon! <em><mark>More info on the image in <a href="attributions.html">attributions.</a></mark></em>

<strong style="text-decoration: underline;">88x31!</strong>
I made the 88x31 in tetra (albeit quite a basic 88x31); <mark class="blue">in Aseprite!</mark>
I went with amaranth for the fish (the fish is kinda based off the favicon just recolored) — then <mark>went through some designs and landed</mark> on the finished thing!
